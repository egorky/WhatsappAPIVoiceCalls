# Environment variables for ARI (Asterisk REST Interface) Connection
# Used by ari_scripts/ari_whatsapp_connector.js

# Full URL to your Asterisk ARI interface
ARI_URL=http://localhost:8088/ari

# Username for ARI authentication (defined in /etc/asterisk/ari.conf)
ARI_USERNAME=asterisk_ari_user

# Password for ARI authentication (defined in /etc/asterisk/ari.conf)
ARI_PASSWORD=ari_password

# Stasis application name that ARI script will register and listen to
# This must match the application name used in extensions.conf Stasis() call
ARI_APP_NAME=whatsapp-ari-app

# Environment variables for Call Routing Logic within ARI script

# Full PJSIP endpoint for your WebRTC client (e.g., PJSIP/1000 or PJSIP/web_client)
# This is where the ARI script will send incoming WhatsApp calls.
WEBRTC_CLIENT_ENDPOINT=PJSIP/web_client

# Full PJSIP endpoint name for dialing out to WhatsApp via your trunk.
# Used if ARI script were to handle outbound calls from WebRTC client to WhatsApp.
# Example: PJSIP/whatsapp_trunk_endpoint (this is the endpoint name, not including the number to dial)
WHATSAPP_TRUNK_ENDPOINT_FOR_OUTBOUND=PJSIP/whatsapp_trunk_endpoint

# Your full WhatsApp Business Number, including country code (e.g., +12345678901)
# Used as CallerID when making outbound calls to WhatsApp.
YOUR_WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_NUMBER=+12345678901

# WhatsApp Cloud API Specifics (Generally configured in Asterisk's pjsip.conf directly)
# These are included for completeness if certain aspects were ever to be made dynamic via the ARI script,
# but for the current setup, they are primarily referenced in pjsip.conf.

# WhatsApp SIP URI (The URI WhatsApp provides for you to send calls TO them)
# Example: sip:your_whatsapp_id@c.whatsapp.net
# Used in pjsip.conf for [whatsapp_trunk_aor] contact and [whatsapp_trunk_endpoint] outbound_proxy
# WHATSAPP_SIP_URI=sip:your_whatsapp_id@c.whatsapp.net

# WhatsApp SIP Domain (The domain from which WhatsApp sends calls TO YOU)
# Example: c.whatsapp.net or a specific subdomain
# Used in pjsip.conf for [whatsapp_trunk_endpoint] from_domain and [whatsapp_trunk_identify] match
# WHATSAPP_SIP_DOMAIN=c.whatsapp.net

# Asterisk Server Details (if needed for other scripts or context, not directly by current ARI script)
# ASTERISK_IP=localhost
# ASTERISK_PJSIP_PORT=5060
# ASTERISK_PJSIP_WS_PORT=8088 # For ws (WebRTC)
# ASTERISK_PJSIP_WSS_PORT=8089 # For wss (Secure WebRTC)

# WebRTC Client Credentials (These are configured in pjsip.conf for the WebRTC client endpoint)
# Example:
# WEBRTC_CLIENT_USERNAME=webclientuser
# WEBRTC_CLIENT_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword
# WEBRTC_CLIENT_EXTENSION=1000

# Note: For the ARI script to work, ensure Asterisk's http.conf and ari.conf are correctly set up.
# The ARI user (ARI_USERNAME) must have permissions to perform actions like originating calls and managing bridges.
# The Stasis application (ARI_APP_NAME) in extensions.conf must direct calls to the ARI script.
# Firewall rules must allow communication between the machine running the ARI script and the Asterisk server on the ARI port.
# If running ARI script on a different machine than Asterisk, replace localhost in ARI_URL with Asterisk's IP.
